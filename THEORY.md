# Coherence: A Unifying Theory of Physics

*By James Dean Conroy*

---

## Overview

The Coherence theory proposes a new scalar field: 
$$C(x,t)$$
 that replaces the concept of curved spacetime from general relativity. Gravity and spacetime geometry are modeled as emergent effects arising from the alignment (or coherence) of quantum wavefunctions. This theory provides a bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics via a unifying field equation:

$$
\square C = -\beta T^\mu_{\ \mu}
$$

This equation suggests that coherence is driven by the trace of the stress-energy tensor. When $T^\mu_{\ \mu}$ is non-zero, coherence emerges and shapes what we perceive as gravity and spacetime.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Coherence Field Definition

We define a wavefunction $\psi(x,t)$ as:

$$
\psi(x,t) = A(x,t) e^{i\phi(x,t)}
$$

The coherence of a region is determined by the alignment of the phase $\phi(x,t)$ across space.

### 2. Coherence Field

The coherence scalar field $C(x,t)$ is defined as a measure of local phase alignment. High coherence corresponds to gravitational effects.

## Coherence Equations

### A. Field Equation

$$
\square C = -\beta T^\mu_{\ \mu}
$$

Where:
- $\square$ is the d'Alembert operator (wave operator).
- $T^\mu_{\ \mu}$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor.
- $\beta$ is a coupling constant.

### B. Weak-Field Metric

Coherence modifies flat Minkowski space:

$$
g_{00} = -(1 + 2\varepsilon C) \\
g_{ij} = (1 - 2\varepsilon C) \delta_{ij}
$$

This mimics gravity in the weak-field limit.

### C. Static Limit (Newtonian Gravity)

In static settings:

$$
\nabla^2 C = \beta \rho
$$

This reproduces Newtonian gravity, where the potential $ \Phi(x) $ emerges from $ C(x) $ via $ C \propto \Phi $.

### D. Cosmological Evolution

In homogeneous cosmology:

$$
\ddot{C} = \beta (\rho - 3p)
$$

This parallels acceleration equations in Friedmann–Lemaître cosmology.

### E. Cosmological Redshift

Light redshift over time is explained by changes in coherence:

$$
\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 + 2\varepsilon C(t_{\text{obs}})}{1 + 2\varepsilon C(t_{\text{emit}})} }
$$

This provides an alternative explanation to redshift without invoking spatial expansion.

## Field Energy and Pressure

We define energy density and pressure of the coherence field:

$$
\rho_C = \frac{1}{2} \dot{C}^2 + V(C) \\
p_C = \frac{1}{2} \dot{C}^2 - V(C)
$$

This allows the field to act like dark energy ($p_C < 0$), radiation, or matter depending on the potential $V(C)$.

## Implications

- **Unification**: Bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity via a single scalar field.
- **Gravity Emergence**: Gravity is an emergent effect from wavefunction alignment.
- **Redshift Reinterpretation**: Cosmological redshift arises from changing coherence, not expanding space.
- **Dark Matter/Energy**: The field $C$ can replicate effects of dark energy and dark matter.
- **Time**: Coherence may underlie the arrow of time as a directional increase in phase alignment.

## Future Directions

- Derive field dynamics from quantum decoherence.
- Fit cosmological data using $C(t)$ instead of scale factor $a(t)$.
- Explore coherence field quantization and interaction with Standard Model fields.

## Summary

The Coherence framework posits that spacetime and gravity emerge from the alignment of quantum phases. This scalar field $C(x,t)$ obeys a relativistic wave equation sourced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor. It recovers Newtonian gravity, general relativity in weak fields, and accounts for cosmic redshift and accelerated expansion without invoking dark energy as a separate substance.
